This portfolio project is a personal website built with React, JavaScript, and CSS. It highlights my computer science coursework, side projects, and professional goals. My audience includes recruiters, potential employers, and tech mentors. These people need clear evidence of what I know, the tools Iâ€™ve used, and the ability to explain my work. I know from LinkedIn and internship listings that most recruiters value personal websites as a supplement to resumes. They want to see not just finished projects, but how I think and build. This site will also help me track my own growth. I have read several articles stating that new computer science graduates are not able to code at expected levels. I am making sure that this does not hold true for me as well.
